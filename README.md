# Skeleton Project

## Overview

Skeleton project used to test concepts / ideas.

## What's included?

This project uses [ejs](http://ejs.co/) as the view engine.  The default port is set to `13337`.  Routes are setup however if routing is not needed, you can shove everything into the `./public` folder as that where static files are setup to serve from.

## TODO

* Remove dependencies
* Remove passport.js related code
* Maybe webpack/parcel + bootstrap?
